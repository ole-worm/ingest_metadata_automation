# ingest_metadata_automation
ingest and metadata automation for backlog artwork files
Use this script to iterate through a digital repository path and capture mediainfo -f reports and md5 checksums for video and audio files, and framemd5s for video files. The reports and checksums will be saved to the condition report folder path set by the user. You will be given the opportunity to organize the artwork folder and add condition/cataloging templates.
